The eclipse will be visible throughout all of Asia and Australia and the central and eastern parts of Europe and Africa.;
Eclipse;Partial Lunar Eclipse;21/09/2025;21/09/2025;21/09/2025;21/09/2025;A partial solar eclipse occurs when the Moon covers only a part of the Sun, sometimes resembling a bite taken out of a cookie.

This partial eclipse will only be visible in New Zealand, Antarctica, and the southern Pacific Ocean. It will be best seen from New Zealand with 76% coverage.;
Planet ;Saturn Opposition;21/09/2025;21/09/2025;21/09/2025;21/09/2025;The ringed planet will be at its closest approach to Earth and its face will be fully illuminated by the Sun.

Supermoon;Supermoon;07/10/2025;07/10/2025;07/10/2025;07/10/2025;This full moon was known by early Native American tribes as the Hunters Moon because at this time of year the leaves are falling and the game is fat and ready to hunt.

Meteor Shower;Draconids Meteor Shower;06/10/2025;10/10/2025;07/10/2025;07/10/2025;The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P Giacobini-Zinner, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an unusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead of early morning like most other showers;
Meteor Shower;Orionids Meteor Shower;02/10/2025;07/11/2025;21/10/2025;22/10/2025;The Orionids is an average shower producing up to 20 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Halley, which has been known and observed since ancient times. The moon will be absent all night long, leaving dark skies for what should be an excellent show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Orion, but can appear anywhere in the sky.;
Planet;Mercury at Greatest Eastern Elongation;29/10/2025;29/10/2025;29/10/2025;29/10/2025;The planet Mercury reaches greatest eastern elongation of 23.9 degrees from the Sun.

Meteor Shower;Taurids Meteor Shower;07/09/2025;10/12/2025;04/11/2025;05/11/2025;The Taurids is a long-running minor meteor shower producing only about 5-10 meteors per hour. It is unusual in that it consists of two separate streams. The first is produced by dust grains left behind by Asteroid 2004 TG10. The second stream is produced by debris left behind by Comet 2P Encke.;

This shower is unique in that it has a cyclonic peak about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. That last of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle, which was discovered in 1865. This should be an excellent year for the Leonids. The thin, crescent moon won't be much of a problem and skies will be dark enough for what should be an great show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight.;
