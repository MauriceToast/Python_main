It is produced by comet Swift-Tuttle, which was discovered in 1862. The Perseids are famous for producing a large number of bright meteors
Planet;Mercury Greatest Western Elongation;2025-07-04;2025-07-04;2025-07-04;2025-07-04;The planet Mercury reaches greatest eastern elongation of 25.9 degrees from the Sun. This is the best time to view Mercury since it will be at its highest point above the horizon in the evening sky. Look for the planet low in the western sky just after sunset
Planet;Mercury Greatest Eastern Elongation;2025-08-19;2025-08-19;2025-08-19;2025-08-19;The planet Mercury reaches greatest western elongation of 18.6 degrees from the Sun. This is the best time to view Mercury since it will be at its highest point above the horizon in the morning sky. Look for the planet low in the eastern sky just before sunrise
Eclipse;Total Lunar Eclipse;2025-09-07;2025-09-07;2025-09-07;2025-09-07;A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes completely through the Earth's dark shadow, or umbra. During this type of eclipse, the Moon will gradually get darker and then take on a rusty or blood red color. The eclipse will be visible throughout all of Asia and Australia and the central and eastern parts of Europe and Africa
Eclipse;Partial Lunar Eclipse;2025-09-21;2025-09-21;2025-09-21;2025-09-21;A partial solar eclipse occurs when the Moon covers only a part of the Sun, sometimes resembling a bite taken out of a cookie. A partial solar eclipse can only be safely observed with a special solar filter or by looking at the Sun's reflection. This partial eclipse will only be visible in New Zealand, Antarctica, and the southern Pacific Ocean. It will be best seen from New Zealand with 76% coverage
Planet;Saturn Opposition;2025-09-21;2025-09-21;2025-09-21;2025-09-21;The ringed planet will be at its closest approach to Earth and its face will be fully illuminated by the Sun. It will be brighter than any other time of the year and will be visible all night long. This is the best time to view and photograph Saturn and its moons. A medium-sized or larger telescope will allow you to see Saturn's rings and a few of its brightest moons
Planet;Neptune Opposition;2025-09-23;2025-09-23;2025-09-23;2025-09-23;The blue giant planet will be at its closest approach to Earth and its face will be fully illuminated by the Sun. It will be brighter than any other time of the year and will be visible all night long. This is the best time to view and photograph Neptune. Due to its extreme distance from Earth, it will only appear as a tiny blue dot in all but the most powerful telescopes
Supermoon;Supermoon;2025-10-07;2025-10-07;2025-10-07;2025-10-07;This full moon was known by early Native American tribes as the Hunters Moon because at this time of year the leaves are falling and the game is fat and ready to hunt. This moon has also been known as the Travel Moon and the Blood Moon. The Moon will be near its closest approach to the Earth and may look slightly larger and brighter than usual
Meteor Shower;Draconids Meteor Shower;2025-10-06;2025-10-10;2025-10-07;2025-10-07;The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P Giacobini-Zinner, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an unusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead of early morning like most other showers
Meteor Shower;Orionids Meteor Shower;2025-10-02;2025-11-07;2025-10-21;2025-10-22;The Orionids is an average shower producing up to 20 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Halley, which has been known and observed since ancient times. The moon will be absent all night long, leaving dark skies for what should be an excellent show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Orion, but can appear anywhere in the sky
Planet;Mercury Greatest Eastern Elongation;2025-10-29;2025-10-29;2025-10-29;2025-10-29;The planet Mercury reaches greatest eastern elongation of 23.9 degrees from the Sun. This is the best time to view Mercury since it will be at its highest point above the horizon in the evening sky. Look for the planet low in the western sky just after sunset
Meteor Shower;Taurids Meteor Shower;2025-09-07;2025-12-10;2025-11-04;2025-11-05;The Taurids is a long-running minor meteor shower producing only about 5-10 meteors per hour. It is unusual in that it consists of two separate streams. The first is produced by dust grains left behind by Asteroid 2004 TG10. The second stream is produced by debris left behind by Comet 2P Encke
Supermoon;Supermoon;2025-11-05;2025-11-05;2025-11-05;2025-11-05;The Moon will be located on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun and its face will be will be fully illuminated. This phase occurs at 13:21 UTC. This full moon was known by early Native American tribes as the Beaver Moon because this was the time of year to set the beaver traps before the swamps and rivers froze. The Moon will be near its closest approach to the Earth and may look slightly larger and brighter than usual
Meteor Shower;Leonids Meteor Shower;2025-11-06;2025-11-30;2025-11-17;2025-11-18;The Leonids is an average shower, producing up to 15 meteors per hour at its peak. This shower is unique in that it has a cyclonic peak about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen.
