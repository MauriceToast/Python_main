It is linked to a stream of interplanetary debris originating from the comets Marsden and Kracht. The name Delta Aquarids comes from the location of its radiant which appears to lie in the constellation Aquarius near the bright star Delta Aquarii
Meteor Shower,Perseids Meteor Shower,2025-07-17T00:00:00Z,2025-08-24T23:59:59Z,2025-08-12T00:20:00Z,2025-08-13T09:00:00Z,Perseids is a meteor shower of high intensity that can produce up to 60 meteors per hour during its peak activity. It is associated with a stream of debris originating from the periodic comet Swift Tuttle which was first observed in 1862. This shower is notable for its frequent appearance of bright meteors. The meteors are called the Perseids because they appear from the general direction of the constellation Perseus and in more modern times have a radiant bordering on Cassiopeia and Camelopardalis.

During this alignment the planet appears brighter than at any other time of the year and remains observable throughout the night. Saturn is not visible to the unaided eye with sufficient detail and requires a telescope to be properly viewed. A medium-sized or larger instrument allows observation of its ring system and several of its prominent moons
Planet,Neptune Opposition,2025-09-23T00:00:00Z,2025-09-23T22:59:59Z,2025-09-23T00:00:00Z,2025-09-23T23:59:59Z,Neptune reaches opposition when it aligns opposite the Sun with Earth in between placing it at its minimum distance from our planet. This alignment results in optimal illumination making Neptune appear at its brightest for the year. Despite this favorable positioning the planet remains invisible to the naked eye due to its vast distance and can only be observed as a small blue disc through a powerful telescope
Supermoon,Supermoon,2025-10-07T00:00:00Z,2025-10-07T23:59:59Z,2025-10-07T03:49:00Z,2025-10-07T03:50:00Z,This full Moon occurs when it is positioned opposite the Sun with Earth in between resulting in complete illumination of its surface. The event takes place at 03:49 UTC. During this phase the Moon is near its closest distance to Earth which can cause it to appear slightly larger and brighter than usual. Traditionally this Moon has been referred to as the Hunters Moon due to seasonal patterns of falling leaves and abundant game. It is also known by other names such as the Travel Moon and the Blood Moon
Meteor Shower,Draconids Meteor Shower,2025-10-06T00:00:00Z,2025-10-10T23:59:59Z,2025-10-07T20:00:00Z,2025-10-07T23:59:00Z,Draconids is a meteor shower of low intensity with an average rate of approximately 10 meteors per hour. It originates from dust particles released by the periodic comet 21P Giacobini Zinner which was first identified in 1900. Unlike most meteor showers which are best viewed in the early morning Draconids are most active during the early evening hours. The meteors appear to radiate from the constellation Draco and are primarily visible in the Northern Hemisphere. Almost all incoming particles disintegrate in the upper atmosphere before reaching Earth's surface. Optimal viewing conditions occur after sunset in locations with unobstructed dark skies. Unfortunately the glare from the nearly full Moon will obstruct visibility and reduce the number of meteors that can be observed this year
Meteor Shower,Orionids Meteor Shower,2025-10-02T00:00:00Z,2025-11-07T23:59:59Z,2025-10-21T18:00:00Z,2025-10-22T12:00:00Z,Orionids is a meteor shower of moderate intensity with peak activity reaching up to 20 meteors per hour. It originates from dust particles released by the periodic comet Halley which has been observed since ancient times. The shower is active annually during late October and typically lasts for about one week. In certain years meteor rates may exceed 50 per hour. The meteors appear to radiate from the constellation Orion although they can be seen across a wide portion of the sky. This year the absence of moonlight will provide ideal dark sky conditions for observation. The best viewing occurs after midnight from a location with minimal light pollution
Planet,Mercury Greatest Eastern Elongation,2025-10-29T00:00:00Z,2025-10-29T23:59:59Z,2025-10-29T00:00:00Z,2025-10-29T23:59:59Z,Mercury reaches its greatest eastern elongation at 23.9 degrees from the Sun which marks the most favorable time for observation.

It is composed of two distinct streams one originating from debris associated with Asteroid 2004 TG10 and the other from material released by the periodic comet 2P Encke. The meteors appear to radiate from the constellation Taurus and are best observed in the late evening sky. Due to their timing in late October and early November they are sometimes referred to as Halloween fireballs. Unfortunately the brightness of the supermoon this year will significantly reduce visibility and obscure most of the meteors
Supermoon,Supermoon,2025-11-05T00:00:00Z,2025-11-05T23:59:59Z,2025-11-05T13:15:00Z,2025-11-05T13:30:30Z,This full Moon occurs when it is positioned opposite the Sun with Earth in between resulting in full illumination of its surface. The event takes place at 13:21 UTC. During this phase the Moon is near its closest distance to Earth which can cause it to appear slightly larger and brighter than usual. Traditionally this Moon has been referred to as the Beaver Moon marking the seasonal period when beaver traps were set before waterways began to freeze
Meteor Shower,Leonids Meteor Shower,2025-11-06T00:00:00Z,2025-11-30T23:59:59Z,2025-11-17T18:00:00Z,2025-11-18T07:00:00Z,The Leonids are an annual meteor shower linked to the comet Tempel–Tuttle typically producing up to 15 meteors per hour. Every 33 years they can erupt into a spectacular storm with hundreds of meteors per hour radiating from the constellation Leo
Planet,Mercury Greatest Western Elongation,2025-12-07T00:00:00Z,2025-12-07T23:59:59Z,2025-12-07T00:00:00Z,2025-12-07T23:59:59Z,Mercury reaches its greatest western elongation at 20.7 degrees from the Sun.

Meteor Shower,Ursids Meteor Shower,2025-12-17T00:00:00Z,2025-12-25T23:59:59Z,2025-12-21T18:00:00Z,2025-12-22T07:00:00Z,The Ursids are a minor meteor shower that typically produces between 5 and 10 meteors per hour and originates from dust left behind by comet Tuttle first observed in 1790 with best viewing just after midnight under dark skies as the early-setting crescent moon will not interfere
Supermoon,Supermoon,2026-01-03T00:00:00Z,2026-01-03T23:59:59Z,2026-01-03T10:04:00Z,2026-01-03T10:05:00Z,This full Moon occurs when it is positioned opposite the Sun with Earth in between resulting in full illumination of its surface. The event takes place at 10:04 UTC. During this phase the Moon is near its closest distance to Earth which can cause it to appear slightly larger and brighter than usual. Traditionally this Moon has been referred to as the Wolf Moon  because this was the time of year when hungry wolf packs howled outside their camps
Meteor Shower,Ursids Meteor Shower,2026-01-01T00:00:00Z,2026-01-05T23:59:59Z,2026-01-03T18:00:00Z,2026-01-04T08:00:00Z,The Quadrantids are a meteor shower above average with up to 40 meteors per hour at their peak. They are produced by dust grains left behind by an extinct celestial body identified as 2003 EH1 discovered in 2003. This object may be linked to comet C1490 Y1 observed by Chinese Japanese and Korean astronomers about 500 years ago. Astronomer Peter Jenniskens proposed this connection in 2003. This year a supermoon will unfortunately obscure most of the meteors leaving only the brightest visible. However with patience and a clear sky it is still possible to catch a few spectacular streaks of light
Planet,Jupiter Opposition,2026-01-10T00:00:00Z,2026-01-10T22:59:59Z,2026-01-10T00:00:00Z,2026-01-10T23:59:59Z,During opposition Jupiter reaches its closest point to Earth and is fully lit by the Sun making it shine at its brightest for the year. It will be visible all night long offering the perfect opportunity to observe or photograph the planet and its moons. With a medium-sized telescope you can spot details in Jupiter’s cloud bands. Even a good pair of binoculars will reveal its four largest moons appearing as bright dots on either side of the planet
Eclipse,Annular Solar Eclipse,2026-02-17T09:56:14Z,2026-02-17T14:27:30Z,2026-02-17T12:11:44Z,2026-02-17T12:11:44Z,An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon is at a greater distance from Earth and its apparent diameter is insufficient to fully obscure the Sun. This alignment results in a visible ring of solar light surrounding the lunar disk commonly referred to as an annulus or “ring of fire.” Unlike total eclipses the solar corona remains hidden during this event. The upcoming eclipse will be observable only from Antarctica and the southern Indian Ocean.The moment of greatest eclipse will occur at 12:11 UTC
Planet,Mercury Greatest Eastern Elongation,2026-02-19T00:00:00Z,2026-02-19T23:59:59Z,2026-02-19T00:00:00Z,2026-02-19T23:59:59Z,Mercury reaches its greatest eastern elongation at 18.1 degrees from the Sun.

They originate from dust particles shed by the long-period comet C1861 G1 Thatcher discovered in 1861. Among showers linked to long-period comets with orbital periods between 200 and 10000 years the Lyrids are the most prominent due to Thatcher’s relatively short orbit of about 415 years. Historical records trace observations of the Lyrids back to 687 BC making them the oldest documented meteor shower still active today
Meteor Shower,Eta Aquarids Meteor Shower,2026-04-19T00:00:00Z,2026-05-28T23:59:59Z,2026-05-06T18:00:00Z,2026-05-07T08:00:00Z,The Eta Aquarids are a strong annual meteor shower with peak rates reaching up to 60 meteors per hour in the Southern Hemisphere and approximately 30 in the Northern Hemisphere. The meteoroids originate from debris released by Comet Halley which has been observed since antiquity. The particles currently intersecting Earth’s orbit separated from the comet several centuries ago. Due to the comet’s present trajectory it no longer passes close enough to Earth to contribute new material to the stream.
Planet,Mercury Greatest Eastern Elongation,2026-06-15T00:00:00Z,2026-06-15T23:59:59Z,2026-06-15T00:00:00Z,2026-06-15T23:59:59Z,Mercury reaches its greatest eastern elongation at 24.5 degrees from the Sun.
